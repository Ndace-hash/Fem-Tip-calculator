## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   SCSS
-   Bootstrap

### What I learned

I used this project to learn the basics of Bootstrap.

-   The Bootstrap 12 column layout
-   CSS Grid systems and flexbox

```html
<h1 class="text-center text-white bg-black">Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```SCSS
   p {
    color: var(--White);
    span {
      color: var(--DarkGrayishCyan2);
    }
  }
```

I also found out that it's okay to scrap all your old work and start all over if you are not fine with what you have.

### Continued development

-   More Sassy CSS features
-   Understanding proper javascript syntax e.g async $ await

### Useful resources

-   [The net ninja SCSS and Bootstrap playlists on Youtube](https://youtube.com/thenetninja) - THis helped me understand SCSS and Bootstrap better.
